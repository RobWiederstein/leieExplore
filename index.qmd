# What?

:::{.notes}
"OIG has the authority to exclude individuals and entities from Federally funded health care programs for a variety of reasons, including a conviction for Medicare or Medicaid fraud. Those that are excluded can receive no payment from Federal health care programs for any items or services they furnish, order, or prescribe. This includes those that provide health benefits funded directly or indirectly by the United States (other than the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan)."[@zotero-2753]

# Why care about the LEIE?

## Machine Learning Pipeline

1. Find data (predictors & <font color="red">outcome</font>)
2. Create features
3. Partition and stratify
4. Choose models
5. Resample
6. Tuning
7. Measure performance
8. Test

## ML Healthcare Fraud Network Graph

![](./img/research_rabbit.png){fig-align="center"}

## Challenges - Class Imbalance

- Reported between .04% and .06% or
- 40 and 60 per 10,000 providers or
- 75/25 split 10 to 15 ++ in test set

## Strategies 

- Random undersampling (90/10 optimal)
- Random oversampling
- Hybrid
- Match LEIE w/ NPI?

## Example Matrix

![](./img/ml_part_b.jpg)

Three years of internal medicine from TX, CA, NY, FL, yielded 89k observations, 2500+ columns,  and 42 fraud cases for a .00047 result.

# Observations

- Total annual exclusions are declining
- Percent of excluded with NPIs is increasing
- UPIN converted to NPIs around 2009
- Medical practice --> to Doctor in 2009

# Questions

- Can the exclusions be scaled?
- What exclusion types are indicative of fraud?
- Are there strategies to boost NPI matches?
- Will the LEIE remain relevant in future fraud detection?

Claims fraud is a major contributor to increased healthcare costs, but its impact can be lessened through fraud detection. In this paper, we compare several machine learning methods to detect Medicare fraud. We perform a comparative study with supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid machine learning approaches using four performance metrics and class imbalance reduction via oversampling and an 80-20 undersampling method. We group the 2015 Medicare data into provider types, with fraud labels from the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities database. Our results show that the successful detection of fraudulent providers is possible, with the 80-20 sampling method demonstrating the best performance across the learners. Furthermore, supervised methods performed better than unsupervised or hybrid methods, but these results varied based on the class imbalance sampling technique and provider type.},

Furthermore, we show that the commonly used ratio of 50:50 (balanced) was not significantly better than using a 99:1 (imbalanced) class distribution. Our study clearly demonstrates the need to apply at least some sampling to big data with class imbalance and suggests the 50:50 class distribution does not produce the best Medicare fraud detection results.},

Even so, associated costs for medical services continue to rise. One aspect contributing to increased costs in healthcare is waste and fraud. In particular, with the rapidly rising elderly population in the United States, programs like Medicare are subject to high losses due to fraud. Therefore, fraud detection approaches are critical in lessening these losses. Even so, many studies using Medicare data do not provide sufficient details regarding data processing and/or integration making it potentially more difficult to understand the experimental results and challenging to reproduce the experiments. In this paper, we present current research using Medicare data to detect fraud, focusing on data processing and/or integration, and assess any gaps in the provided data-related details. We then present discussions on important details to look for when processing and merging different Medicare datasets indicating opportunities for future work.},

Fraud in the United States (U.S.) Medicare program is an ongoing issue resulting in higher healthcare costs for beneficiaries. In this paper, we present an empirical study of several unsupervised machine learning methods to detect outliers, indicating fraudulent medical providers, using the Medicare Part B big dataset. We employ two methods, Isolation Forest and Unsupervised Random Forest, which have not previously been used for the detection of Medicare fraud, along with more commonly used methods to include Local Outlier Factor, autoencoders, and k-Nearest Neighbors. In order to validate the fraud detection performance of each method, we use the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE) database which contains information on excluded providers. Moreover, we present details on processing the Part B data and incorporating the LEIE fraud labels. Our results indicate that Local Outlier Factor is the best outlier detection method and k-Nearest Neighbors, with 5 neighbors, and autoencoders are the worst at detecting Medicare Part B fraud.},

This rising elderly population continues to demand more cost-effective healthcare programs. Medicare is a vital program serving the needs of the elderly in the United States. The growing number of Medicare beneficiaries, along with the enormous volume of money in the healthcare industry, increases the appeal for, and risk of, fraud. In this paper, we focus on the detection of Medicare Part B provider fraud which involves fraudulent activities, such as patient abuse or neglect and billing for services not rendered, perpetrated by providers and other entities who have been excluded from participating in Federal healthcare programs. We discuss Part B data processing and describe a unique process for mapping fraud labels with known fraudulent providers. The labeled big dataset is highly imbalanced with a very limited number of fraud instances. In order to combat this class imbalance, we generate seven class distributions and assess the behavior and fraud detection performance of six different machine learning methods. Our results show that RF100 using a 90:10 class distribution is the best learner with a 0.87302 AUC. Moreover, learner behavior with the 50:50 balanced class distribution is similar to more imbalanced distributions which keep more of the original data. Based on the performance and significance testing results, we posit that retaining more of the majority class information leads to better Medicare Part B fraud detection performance over the balanced datasets across the majority of learners.},

In just 6 categories of waste\textemdash overtreatment, failures of care coordination, failures in execution of care processes, administrative complexity, pricing failures, and fraud and abuse\textemdash the sum of the lowest available estimates exceeds 20\% of total health care expenditures. The actual total may be far greater. The savings potentially achievable from systematic, comprehensive, and cooperative pursuit of even a fractional reduction in waste are far higher than from more direct and blunter cuts in care and coverage. The potential economic dislocations, however, are severe and require mitigation through careful transition strategies.},

Another set of algorithms estimates propagation of risk from fraudulent healthcare providers through geospatial collocation, i.e., shared practice locations or other addresses. The algorithms were evaluated with respect to their ability to predict a provider's presence on the Office of the Inspector General's list of providers excluded from participation in Medicare and other Federal healthcare programs (exclusion). In an empirical evaluation, a combination of 11 features achieved an f-score of 0.919 and a ROC area of 0.960 in exclusion prediction. An ablation analysis showed that most of this predictive accuracy was the result of features that measure risk propagation through geospatial collocation.},

There has been a growing emphasis to explore the promise of big data analytics in tapping the potential of the massive healthcare data emanating from private and government health insurance providers. While the domain implications of such collaboration are well known, this type of data has been explored to a limited extent in the data mining community. The objective of this paper is two fold: first, we introduce the emerging domain of "big" healthcare claims data to the KDD community, and second, we describe the success and challenges that we encountered in analyzing this data using state of art analytics for massive data. Specifically, we translate the problem of analyzing healthcare data into some of the most well-known analysis problems in the data mining community, social network analysis, text mining, and temporal analysis and higher order feature construction, and describe how advances within each of these areas can be leveraged to understand the domain of healthcare. Each case study illustrates a unique intersection of data mining and healthcare with a common objective of improving the cost-care ratio by mining for opportunities to improve healthcare operations and reducing what seems to fall under fraud, waste, and abuse.},

  abstract = {In the United States, advances in technology and medical sciences continue to improve the general well-being of the population. With this continued progress, programs such as Medicare are needed to help manage the high costs associated with quality healthcare. Unfortunately, there are individuals who commit fraud for nefarious reasons and personal gain, limiting Medicare's ability to effectively provide for the healthcare needs of the elderly and other qualifying people. To minimize fraudulent activities, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a number of ``Big Data'' datasets for different parts of the Medicare program. In this paper, we focus on the detection of Medicare fraud using the following CMS datasets: (1) Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Physician and Other Supplier (Part B), (2) Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Part D Prescriber (Part D), and (3) Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Referring Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS). Additionally, we create a fourth dataset which is a combination of the three primary datasets. We discuss data processing for all four datasets and the mapping of real-world provider fraud labels using the List of Excluded Individuals and Entities (LEIE) from the Office of the Inspector General. Our exploratory analysis on Medicare fraud detection involves building and assessing three learners on each dataset. Based on the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve performance metric, our results show that the Combined dataset with the Logistic Regression (LR) learner yielded the best overall score at 0.816, closely followed by the Part B dataset with LR at 0.805. Overall, the Combined and Part B datasets produced the best fraud detection performance with no statistical difference between these datasets, over all the learners. Therefore, based on our results and the assumption that there is no way to know within which part of Medicare a physician will commit fraud, we suggest using the Combined dataset for detecting fraudulent behavior when a physician has submitted payments through any or all Medicare parts evaluated in our study.},

  abstract = {The United States healthcare system produces an enormous volume of data with a vast number of financial transactions generated by physicians administering healthcare services. This makes healthcare fraud difficult to detect, especially when there are considerably less fraudulent transactions (documented and readily available) than non-fraudulent. The ability to successfully detect fraudulent activities in healthcare, given such discrepancies, can garner up to \$350 billion in recovered monetary losses. In machine learning, when one class has a substantially larger number of instances (majority) compared to the other (minority), this is known as class imbalance. In this paper, we focus specifically on Medicare, utilizing three `Big Data' Medicare claims datasets with real-world fraudulent physicians. We create a training and test dataset for all three Medicare parts, both separately and combined, to assess fraud detection performance. To emulate class rarity, which indicates particularly severe levels of class imbalance, we generate additional datasets, by removing fraud instances, to determine the effects of rarity on fraud detection performance. Before a machine learning model can be distributed for real-world use, a performance evaluation is necessary to determine the best configuration (e.g. learner, class sampling ratio) and whether the associated error rates are low, indicating good detection rates. With our research, we demonstrate the effects of severe class imbalance and rarity using a training and testing (Train\_Test) evaluation method via a hold-out set, and provide our recommendations based on the supervised machine learning results. Additionally, we repeat the same experiments using Cross-Validation, and determine it is a viable substitute for Medicare fraud detection. For machine learning with the severe class imbalance datasets, we found that, as expected, fraud detection performance decreased as the fraudulent instances became more rare. We apply Random Undersampling to both Train\_Test and Cross-Validation, for all original and generated datasets, in order to assess potential improvements in fraud detection by reducing the adverse effects of class imbalance and rarity. Overall, our results indicate that the Train\_Test method significantly outperforms Cross-Validation.},

Previous work has shown that publicly available Medicare claims data can be leveraged to construct machine learning models capable of automating fraud detection, but challenges associated with class-imbalanced big data hinder performance. With a minority class size of 0.03\% and an opportunity to improve existing results, we use the Medicare fraud detection task to compare six deep learning methods designed to address the class imbalance problem. Data-level techniques used in this study include random over-sampling (ROS), random under-sampling (RUS), and a hybrid ROS\textendash RUS. The algorithm-level techniques evaluated include a cost-sensitive loss function, the Focal Loss, and the Mean False Error Loss. A range of class ratios are tested by varying sample rates and desirable class-wise performance is achieved by identifying optimal decision thresholds for each model. Neural networks are evaluated on a 20\% holdout test set, and results are reported using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results show that ROS and ROS\textendash RUS perform significantly better than baseline and algorithm-level methods with average AUC scores of 0.8505 and 0.8509, while ROS\textendash RUS maximizes efficiency with a 4\texttimes{} speedup in training time. Plain RUS outperforms baseline methods with up to 30\texttimes{} improvements in training time, and all algorithm-level methods are found to produce more stable decision boundaries than baseline methods. Thresholding results suggest that the decision threshold always be optimized using a validation set, as we observe a strong linear relationship between the minority class size and the optimal threshold. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare multiple data-level and algorithm-level deep learning methods across a range of class distributions. Additional contributions include a unique analysis of the relationship between minority class size and optimal decision threshold and state-of-the-art performance on the given Medicare fraud detection task.},

  abstract = {This study evaluates the use of deep learning and data sampling on a class-imbalanced Big Data problem, i.e. Medicare fraud detection. Medicare offers affordable health insurance to the elderly population and serves more than 15\% of the United States population. To increase transparency and help reduce fraud, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have made several data sets publicly available for analysis. Our research group has conducted several studies using CMS data and traditional machine learning algorithms (non-deep learning), but challenges associated with severe class imbalance leave room for improvement. These previous studies serve as baselines as we employ deep neural networks with various data-sampling techniques to determine the efficacy of deep learning in addressing class imbalance. Random over-sampling (ROS), random under-sampling (RUS), and combinations of the two (ROS-RUS) are applied to study how varying levels of class imbalance impact model training and performance. Classwise performance is maximized by identifying optimal decision thresholds, and a strong linear relationship between minority class size and optimal threshold is observed. Results show that ROS significantly outperforms RUS, combining RUS and ROS both maximizes performance and efficiency with a 4 x speedup in training time, and the default threshold of 0.5 is never optimal when training data is imbalanced. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide statistical results comparing ROS, RUS, and ROS-RUS deep learning methods across a range of class distributions. Additional contributions include a unique analysis of thresholding as it relates to the minority class size and state-of-the-art performance on the given fraud detection task.},

  abstract = {Background: We aimed to identify the indicators of healthcare fraud and abuse in general physicians' drug prescription claims, and to identify a subset of general physicians that were more likely to have committed fraud and abuse. ,  Methods: We applied data mining approach to a major health insurance organization dataset of private sector general physicians' prescription claims. It involved 5 steps: clarifying the nature of the problem and objectives, data preparation, indicator identification and selection, cluster analysis to identify suspect physicians, and discriminant analysis to assess the validity of the clustering approach. ,  Results: Thirteen indicators were developed in total. Over half of the general physicians (54\%) were `suspects' of conducting abusive behavior. The results also identified 2\% of physicians as suspects of fraud. Discriminant analysis suggested that the indicators demonstrated adequate performance in the detection of physicians who were suspect of perpetrating fraud (98\%) and abuse (85\%) in a new sample of data. ,  Conclusion: Our data mining approach will help health insurance organizations in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) in streamlining auditing approaches towards the suspect groups rather than routine auditing of all physicians.},

  abstract = {Inappropriate payments by insurance organizations or third party payers occur because of errors, abuse and fraud. The scale of this problem is large enough to make it a priority issue for health systems. Traditional methods of detecting health care fraud and abuse are time-consuming and inefficient. Combining automated methods and statistical knowledge lead to the emergence of a new interdisciplinary branch of science that is named Knowledge Discovery from Databases (KDD). Data mining is a core of the KDD process. Data mining can help third-party payers such as health insurance organizations to extract useful information from thousands of claims and identify a smaller subset of the claims or claimants for further assessment. We reviewed studies that performed data mining techniques for detecting health care fraud and abuse, using supervised and unsupervised data mining approaches. Most available studies have focused on algorithmic data mining without an emphasis on or application to fraud detection efforts in the context of health service provision or health insurance policy. More studies are needed to connect sound and evidence-based diagnosis and treatment approaches toward fraudulent or abusive behaviors. Ultimately, based on available studies, we recommend seven general steps to data mining of health care claims.},

  abstract = {The US spends more than 4 trillion dollars per year on health care, largely conducted by private providers and reimbursed by insurers. A major concern in this system is overbilling, waste and fraud by providers, who face incentives to misreport on their claims in order to receive higher payments. In this work, we develop novel machine learning tools to identify providers that overbill insurers. Using large-scale claims data from Medicare, the US federal health insurance program for elderly adults and the disabled, we identify patterns consistent with fraud or overbilling among inpatient hospitalizations. Our proposed approach for fraud detection is fully unsupervised, not relying on any labeled training data, and is explainable to end users, providing reasoning and interpretable insights into the potentially suspicious behavior of the flagged providers. Data from the Department of Justice on providers facing anti-fraud lawsuits and case studies of suspicious providers validate our approach and findings. We also perform a post-analysis to understand hospital characteristics, those not used for detection but associate with a high suspiciousness score. Our method provides an 8-fold lift over random targeting, and can be used to guide investigations and auditing of suspicious providers for both public and private health insurance systems.},

  abstract = {Healthcare is an essential in people's lives and it must be affordable. The healthcare industry is an intricate system with numerous moving components. It is expanding at an expeditious pace. At the same time, fraud in this industry is turning into a critical problem. One of the issues is the misuse of the medical insurance systems. Manual detection of frauds in the healthcare industry is a strenuous work. Recently, machine learning and data mining techniques are used for automatically detecting the healthcare frauds. In this paper, we attempt to give a review on frauds in healthcare industry and the techniques for detecting such frauds. With an emphasis on the techniques used, determining the significant sources and the features of the healthcare data, various available researches were studied in the literature work. From this review it can be concluded that the advanced machine learning techniques and incipiently acquired sources of the healthcare data would be forthcoming subjects of interest in order to make the healthcare affordable, to improve the effectiveness of healthcare fraud detection and to bestow top quality on healthcare systems. Many recent researches, as reviewed in this paper, use machine learning and data mining to detect fraud in healthcare industry. There is a need additional research work to determine different unusual patterns of misuse of health insurance systems and more sophisticated machine learning techniques can be used to improve results.},
